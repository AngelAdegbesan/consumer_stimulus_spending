      <h1>How Are Americans Using Their Stimulus Checks?</h1>

      <div class="container date">
        <h4> March 23, 2021 </h4>
        <h3> By Angel Adegbesan </h3>
      </div>

      <p> President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law on March 12, allowing coronovarius relief to be extended to millions of Americans. The law is the third of its kind in a year since the coronavirus outbreak last
        March.
      </p>

      <h3> The First </h3>
      <p>As part of the lump-sum economic impact payments, qualifying adults have received $1,200, $600 and are bound to receive $1,400 in individual payments.

        According to a survey by the New York Federal Reserve done in Oct. 2020, about 18% of these funds was used for essentials (daily living expenses), 8% was used for non-essential (hobbies, leisure and vacation), 35% was used to pay down debt
        and about 36% of the payment was saved.
      </p>

      <h3> The Second </h3>
      <p>After the first round of payments, it became clear that people who are non-white, without a college degree and in lower-income households that have had financial setbacks because of the pandemic, are more likely to use a huge chunk their
        payments to pay down debts. The poll, done by SurveyMonkey, also showed that their counterparts, on the other hand, are more likely to save most of their payments. People of color are also more likely to spend a larger portion of their
        stimulus than white people. </p>
